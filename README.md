# Portfolio

## This is an ongoing site that will be updated with more information and projects as time goes on in my career.

## Fist setting up the HTML, I wanted a page that displays myself as a devloper and will showcase my experience, skills and projects that I have completed thus far. Seeing as though I curretly have no experience, I put a text that reads "Coming Soon". I then took screen shots of my past projects with a quick description and a link to lead the person to the page.

## The Nav bar also sends the user to the selected areas listed on click. Footer contatins a copy right.
